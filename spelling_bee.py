# Based on NYTimes Spelling Bee <3
# https://www.nytimes.com/puzzles/spelling-bee/

#~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~#next steps#~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~#
#~~~~#new features#~~~~#
# make it smarter at picking letters! too hard rn!
# get an easier word list, this one is wild
# make the interface cuter: specifically letter display
# add in a shuffle letters function
# find pangrams, do something exciting for those
### add in more logic for why a guess is invalid, not enough letters, doesn't contain center letter, contains letters not in the 7
# make a progress bar to go with statements, make it look cute
# choose difficulty, based on word list, letters generated, maybe give each word a diff score, and some of all those is puzzle diff
# give extra points for longer words, and pangrams
# alphabetize list of found words
# add option to input your own letters - to use as a solver
# hint grid - or a different hint setup
# twist the game, liek speed bee with a timer
#~~~~#bugs#~~~~#
# make it so get_wordlist doesn't run every new game (on solve for valid words)
# when you give up, it reevaluates input bar and tells u u already have word
# make it so when you win, the try a word input goes away
# make it so letter clear guess a word input after hitting enter
